## Data transformation 
 
W e   first   read   the   train   and   test   data   into   R   and   then   combine   them   using   cbind()   and   rbind()   and   give   appropriate   column   names   and also  name the   activity   column with appropriate   level s .   We   then   subset  the   data   to   get   have  only  those  columns that  have  mean   and  std  name in it.  We then observe that there are many values for any particular combination subject and activity.  We need to group these values and then find the mean. This was done using the melt( )  and  dcast( ) function which gave us the  clean data. 
 The final data has 68 columns where the first two are identifier s. The remaining 66 variables are the mean of values of different kinds of measurement for every particular combination of subject and activities.  Hence this agrees to the all the requisites of a tidy data.     

## Identifiers 

Subject (int) – identifier which varies from 1 to 30
 
 activity(factor) w/ 6 levels which varies from 1 to 6

 where 
* 1 WALKING
* 2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
* 3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
* 4 SITTING
* 5 STANDING
* 6 LAYING

## Variables 
66   variables of the type num represent the mean values under that particular measurement.
